### Bullet Hell
This is a top-down space shooter game I have made some time ago with SFML.<br/>
It is, in my opinion, quite fun, but the code isn't very good.<br/>
I have uploaded it here not only to share it, but also to hopefully encourage myself to refactor it.<br/>

## Building
The game is meant to be built in an appropriate build folder in the root of the project, otherwise the assets won't be found.<br/>
A recent version of SFML needs to be installed.<br/>

## Controls
Movement: `WASD`, `IJKL` or `arrow keys`<br/>
Shoot: `Spacebar`<br/>
Auto-Shoot: `G`<br/>
Switch Ship Type: `1 2 3` or `8 9 0`

## Gameplay
The game is mostly about dodging bullets.<br/>
There is no real way to win, just try to beat your high score and have fun.<br/>
Here is a small gif to show the game in movement.<br/>
